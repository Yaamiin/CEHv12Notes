          - User switches to cellular network
  - BYOD Security Policy
    + Will allow for a secure and controllable BYOD environment
      - Define requirements
        + Who/What/When/Where/Why will this device be used
      - Standardize technology
        + Hardware and Software
          - List approved devices
          - List approved apps
      - Formalize policies
        + Publish and disseminate policy info
      - Implement Security
        + Asset and Identity Management

        + Network Access Control
        + Device password
        + Org vs Personal App control
        + Web security
        + Messaging security
        + Device Health
        + DLP
      - Implement Support
        + Trained support staff
