Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ What is OT
  - Operational Technology
    + Managing, Monitoring, and Controlling industrial operations
      - Focused on the physical devices and processes they use

+ OT Components/Systems
  - ICS (Industrial Control System)
  - SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)
    - Gathers and presents data to operators
    - Make decisions about processes with the aid of operator input
    - Control plant functions based on those decisions
  - DCS (Distributed Control System)
    + Like SCADA, but focused more on processes and automation
      - Less interaction with the operator
  - PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
  - RTU (Remote Terminal Unit)
    + aka Remote Telemetry Unit and Remote Telecontrol Unit
      - A 'beefed-up' PLC
        + Better environmental tolerances
        + Backup power options
        + Autonomy
  - BPCS (Basic Process Control System)
  - SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems)
    + Sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements
      - Protects personnel, equipment, and environment
        + Isolates the plant in case of an emergency
  - HMI (Human Machine Interface)
    + Screen that allows a human to interact with a machine
      - Data input/output
        + Subset of SCADA
  - IED (Intelligent Electronic Devices)
    + Devices that receive data from sensors and/or power equipment
      - Issue control commands like
        + Tripping breakers during voltage/current/frequency anomalies
          - Example device: voltage regulator
  - IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things)
    + The convergence of OT and IT
      - Using traditional IT infrastructure to manage OT devices

+ OT Security Challenges
  - Plain Text Passwords/Protocols
  - Complexity
  - Proprietary tech
  - Legacy Tech
  - Lack of security professionals
  - Converging with IT brings in IT Security issues
