+ Today we're talking about the Deep/Dark Web. Can we start by defining some
  of these terms?
  - Surface Web
    + Normal websites you're used to browsing to
      - Facebook
      - Google
  - Deep Web
    + The part of the internet not reachable(indexed) by search engines
      - It's kinda 'hidden'
        + Think of content behind a paywall
        + Cloud storage
        + Web mail
        + Banking
          - Actually represents something like +/-%96 of internet content
+ It can get confusing from here as we get into the Dark Net and the Dark Web.
  What is the difference?
  - Dark Net
    + This is where it gets weird
      - Meant to be an 'anonymous' and hidden network by nature
        + Uses encryption
        + Can require special browsers
          - 2 types of Dark Nets
            + Friend-2-Friend
              - Very anonymous Peer-2-Peer network
                + https://freenetproject.org
                + https://retroshare.cc/
            + Privacy Networks
              - Tor
  - Dark Web
    + Dark Web and Dark Net are 'related'
    + Best described as 'websites that exist on the Dark Net'
      - Much of it is pretty nasty stuff
+ How do we access the Dark Web? Is that what the Tor browser is all about?
  - Tor browser demo
