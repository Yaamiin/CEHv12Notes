Vulnerability Assessment Concepts and Resources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Define vulnerability research and explain its usefulness in the VA process
- List common resources used when conducting vulnerability research
- Define and explain the concepts and practices of Vulnerability Assessments
- Explain the concept and application of vulnerability databases and scoring
  systems

+ What is a Vulnerability Assessment?
  - Looking at a system to discover security weaknesses (aka Vulnerability)
    + Helps get ahead of potential breaches
      - Test new security controls and their effectiveness

+ How do Vulnerability Assessors / Ethical Hackers stay current with contemporary
  vulnerabilities and exploits?
  - Vulnerability Research
    + Threat Feeds
    + Discovered Security Flaws
    + Professional Development

+ How is a VA done?
  - Active and Passive scanning
    + Software
      - Nessus
      - OpenVAS

+ Tell us about Vulnerability Metrics and Databases?
  - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
    + Multiple versions
      - 2.0, 3.0, 3.1
        + https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.0/specification-document
        + 3.0 Specs
          - None    0.0
          - Low     0.1 - 3.9
          - Med     4.0 - 6.9
          - High    7.0 - 8.9
          - Crit    9.0 - 10.0
  - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
