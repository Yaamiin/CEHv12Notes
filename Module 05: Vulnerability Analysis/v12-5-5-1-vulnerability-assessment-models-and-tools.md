Vulnerability Assessment Models and Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Define and describe the philosophical and tactical difference between VA
  solution models
- Describe the attributes of an effective VA solution
- List and define the common types of Vulnerability Assessment tools
- Identify the criteria for choosing a Vulnerability Assessment tool
- Recognize industry standard VA tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


+ What types of Vulnerability Assessment Models do we need to be aware of?
  - Product-Based Methods
    + Install the VA software locally/internally
      - Won't be able to give you an 'outside-in' assessment
  - Service-Based Methods
    + 3rd-party runs scans
      - Both inside and outside assessments
        + Opens visibility into air-gapped systems
+ What types of Vulnerability Assessments **strategies** do we need to be aware of?
  - Tree-based
    + Multiple scans are run
      - Scans are customized to the host/service/database
  - Inference-based
    + Scanner starts broad and utilizes discovered info to infer the next step
      - Find host
        + Discover protocols
          - Enumerate open ports
            + Enumerate service
              - Employ known vulns against service
+ What Vulnerability Assessment tools types do we need to be aware of?
  - Host-based
  - Depth assessment
    + Discovers new vulnerabilities
      - Fuzzers
  - Application-layer
    + Web app assessment
    + Database assessment
  - Mobile Assessment Tools
  - Location and Data Examination Tools
    + Network-based
      - oddly enough is only able to scan the host it's installed on
    + Agent-based
      - Scans the local host or can scan other hosts on the network
    + Proxy scanner
      - Can scan the network from any machine on the network
    + Cluster scanner
      - Same as proxy, but can scan multiple machines at one time
